      <description>Every blog needs a first entry. This is mine.
From time to time, I will share links to great essays that have influenced me in one way or another. I will begin with William Davies&amp;rsquo; spot on analysis of the standing of statistics in today&amp;rsquo;s society, published in 2017 in the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;The long read&amp;rsquo;  series.
Although the essay has been written in 2017, I imagine that &amp;ndash; unfortunately &amp;ndash; it will be an important source for years to come.</description>
