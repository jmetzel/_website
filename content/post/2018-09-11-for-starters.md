Every blog needs a first entry. This is mine. 

From time to time, I will share links to great essays that have influenced me in one way or another. I will begin with William Davies' spot on analysis of the [standing of statistics in today's society](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/crisis-of-statistics-big-data-democracy), published in 2017 in the Guardian's ['The long read' ](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read) series.

Although the essay has been written in 2017, I imagine that -- unfortunately -- it will be an important source for years to come. Evidently, a crucial task for scientists and data analysts in the next years will be to develop strategies for more transparency and better outreach to the general population. 

Luckily, the calls for transparency and [open science](https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/open-science/) are becoming louder and more and more institutions are committing themselves to the ideals of open science, for example by promoting the publication of research articles under as [open access](https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/open-access/). 

Whether or not these advances will help to decelerate the waning trust in science and empirical research findings and whether or not they will help to restrain populism is one of the most important questions today.
