title: About Me
---

My name is Julian M. Etzel, I am a psychologist and research scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education, [IPN](http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/), in Kiel, Germany. I am part of the [Department of Educational Measurement](https://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/en/the-ipn/departments/research-methodology). My research interests are *vocational interests*, *person-environment fit*, and *personality profiles*. 

Since the earliest days of my studies, I am fascinated by and strongly interested in quantitative research methods and data analysis in psychology and the social sciences in general. Due to the inherent sophistication of these methods, I have spent many hours (and will spend many more in the future) trying to understand how to get from raw data to data we can actually work with and, finally, to the results of statistical methods like *t*-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear and logistic regression models, structural equation models (SEMs) and on how to interpret these results correctly.  

On this website, I occassionally write about:
 
 - Tutorials for common data analytic problems
 - Problems and solutions of non-standard data analysis tasks, especially with [R](https://cran.r-project.org)
 - Functions that make you life easier
 
Everything expressed on this website reflects my personal opinions, ideas, and thoughts. Tutorials and code examples are created to the best of my knowledge. Although I check everything very carefully, I cannot guarantee for the unquestionable correctness of my examples. Naturally, I do not claim that my way of solving data analytical problems is:

- the __only__ way to solve a problem
- the __fastest__ way to solve a problem
- the __best__ way to solve a problem
- the __most elegant__ way to solve a problem

Mistakes are human and admitting mistakes is, in my humble opinion, a sign of strength, not of weakness. So if you ever come across something that is just plain wrong, or if you want to share your own ways of solving a particular problem, feel free to contact me via the social media channels linked in the footer.
